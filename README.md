# Filter Project Frontend

This repository contains the frontend of the Filter Project, a water filter maintenance application built with React.

## Overview

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the application. It's built using React and Bootstrap for UI components, with date-fns and moment.js for handling dates. It communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to fetch and manipulate data.

To get the full functionality of the application, you'll need to have the backend running as well. The backend can be found at this repository: [Filter Project Backend](https://github.com/patcont/filter-project-backend)
